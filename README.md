# A Simple Kanban App

A basic kanban board built with React using `dnd-kit` and `redux-toolkit`.

## Fixes

There are minor fixes that have been made past the deadline because I was simply annoyed with them. In order to view the submission in its original state please check out the 'submission' branch.

## Setup

The project has been set up with yarn so a simple

```
yarn install
```

followed by a

```
yarn dev
```

should suffice to run the project.

This project has been built with Vite. If you wish to build the project and run it in production mode, after a `yarn install`, simply run

```
yarn build
```

and subsequently

```
yarn preview
```

## üêõ Known Issues

- Users can do everything outside of moving cards on mobile - A custom implementation of the `MouseSensor` class for `dnd-kit` had to be used, which meant that the touch-supported built-in class could not be used.
- There is a strange issue with the built-in collision detection on `dnd-kit` wherein high resolution screens mess with it. If you are unable to move cards to empty containers, consider resizing the browser window (this really isn't ideal but I ran out of time before I could write a custom implementation of the collision detection) (FIXED)
- Adding a card to the end of a populated container _sometimes_ gets placed in the second last slot (FIXED)
